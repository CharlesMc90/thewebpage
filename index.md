# Welcome to My Personal Webpage

## About Me
Hello! My name is Charles, and I'm excited to share a little bit about myself with you. I love to game, spend time with my family, and watch sports. 

I'm currently learning more about web development, and this page is one of my first attempt at it. I'm constantly curious and always looking for new things to learn and create. I'm a Air Force Vet who is orignally from Maryland. I served for 6 years and after starting a family here I decided to stay. I made an attempt at college years ago and I am now taking an honest attempt at while I still have the time to do it. I have 6 daughters all whom have their own piece of my heart.

## My Hobbies
One of my biggest hobbies is streaming games. I enjoy playing Madden and Apex right now. I also enjoy drawing as well because it allows me to express myself creatively.
